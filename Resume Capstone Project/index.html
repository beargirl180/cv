        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Combining knowledge from advertising and other promotional material with hands on experience from print production, I specialise in creating unique and memorable messages through layout and design.</p>
        <p>I am a mature, positive and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest standard possible at any given task. I posses excellent communication skills and I have the ability and experience to relate to a wide range of people. I enjoy learning new things, I can work very well under pressure, and I have the sales experience to handle customer complaints and solving problematic situations.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in the UK, but moved down to the sunny southern coast of Spain in 2007. From there I moved slightly down the coast and ended up in Gibraltar, where I live with my dog. </p>
